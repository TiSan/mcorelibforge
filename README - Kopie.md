# MCoreLib Forge
The ultimative mod for your forge mod. Desinged by a bukkit lover. Designed for you.

# What does this forge mod?
This mod provides a library for mod developers. You can easily create connections between server and client, make blocks and items
in just one command and use bukkit-like plugins for your server.

# How does the plugin library work?
MCoreForge comes with the possibility to create plugins for your server. You can create GUI frames, blocks, items and other stuff which
you can find in the forge library. If you have a server, you can upload your bukkit-like plugin into the plugins folder of your
forge server and very easily to your players. Just upload the .jar file on a webspace, the clients search the multiplayer server
list of the clients about your server and search available plugins to download and install. Every client do this at his startup, 
so your plugins are up-to-date on the clients game!

# Is it free to use?
Yes! It is fully open-source and free to use. If you want to add this mod to your modpack or use it for your server, it would be
glad to see if you leave a small message about the developer and the github page of this mod in your credits page. 

# Now develop your own plugin like you want to do!

Hint: This mod is in highly development! The code can be change rapidly and the compatibility of the future versions are not
guaranteed. If the mod state switches to stable or beta, you can find this information on this github page. I take no guarantee for
the fully-working of this mod. 

Please report bugs and problems. If you have feedback, tell this too.
